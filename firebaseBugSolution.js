To handle non-existent fields gracefully, use optional chaining (`?.`) or check for the field's existence before accessing it:

```javascript
const data = await getDoc(docRef);
const value = data.field?.value || null; // Optional chaining

// Or explicit check:

if (data.hasOwnProperty('field')) {
  const value = data.field.value;
} else {
  const value = null; // Or a default value
}
```

For security rule errors, carefully review your Firebase security rules in the Firebase console.  Ensure they grant the correct permissions to authenticated users based on the operations they need to perform and the data they need to access.

Common security rule mistakes include:

*   Forgetting to allow reads or writes.
*   Incorrectly specifying user authentication conditions.
*   Overly restrictive rules that block valid actions.
