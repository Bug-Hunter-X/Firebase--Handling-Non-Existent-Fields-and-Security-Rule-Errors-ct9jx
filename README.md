# Firebase Data Access and Security Rule Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase development: encountering errors when accessing fields that don't exist or due to improperly configured Firebase security rules.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem

The Firebase SDK often throws confusing errors when attempting to access a field that's not present in your data.  Similarly, incorrect security rules lead to permission-denied errors despite seemingly correct code.

## Solution

The provided solution emphasizes the importance of checking for the existence of fields before accessing them using optional chaining or similar approaches.  Ensure your Firebase security rules allow the necessary access to the data based on user authentication and data structure.
