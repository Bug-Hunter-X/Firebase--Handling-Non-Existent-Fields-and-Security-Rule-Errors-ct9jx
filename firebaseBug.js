The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your data structure.  For example:

```javascript
const data = await getDoc(docRef);
console.log(data.nonExistentField); //Error!
```
This is common when dealing with dynamically generated data structures or incomplete data.  The error is often cryptic, making it difficult to diagnose.
Another less common but potentially troublesome error relates to security rules not being properly set up, resulting in permission denied errors even when your code appears correct.
